# ETL Pipelines Tutorial | World Bank Datasets
 design, manage and optimize the flow of data with dynamic pipelines. This project uses data from the World Bank comes from two sources. you'll create a single Python module that creates a pipeline in these datasets, transforms them, and loads the results into the database all in dynamic pipelines. ✨🎯💥

- ETL Tools : Extract Transform Load (ETL) is a category of technologies that move data between systems. These tools access data from many different technologies, and then apply rules to “transform” and cleanse the data so that it is ready for analysis.

**ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load.**

This project uses data from the World Bank. The data comes from two sources:

[World Bank Indicator Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) - This data contains socio-economic indicators for countries around the world. A few example indicators include population, arable land, and central government debt.

[World Bank Project Data](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-bank-projects-operations) - This data set contains information about World Bank project lending since 1947.
